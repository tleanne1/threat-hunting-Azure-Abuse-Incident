## Threat Hunt Report: Azure Abuse Incident Involving Brute-Force Attacks

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Summary
This report summarizes the results of a threat hunt investigation in response to a Microsoft Azure Safeguards Team abuse notice. Microsoft flagged IP address `20.81.228.191`, associated with Azure VM `sakel-lunix-2`, for brute-force traffic. The investigation confirms the abuse report, identifies the initial compromise point (Ground Zero), and outlines attacker activity, persistence, and lateral movement.

Although no successful login was directly tied to a remote IP, a root-level process (`dash`) was executed immediately after 101 failed login attempts from IP `37.32.15.8`. We assess with high confidence that this IP is the source of the compromise.

**Date:** March 2025
**Subscription ID:** `3c95e63a-895a-4386-991e-edbbf57de5c8`
**Impacted Resource:** `sakel-lunix-2` (Geo: East US 2)

## Validation of Abuse Claim

- Confirmed brute-force traffic from `sakel-lunix-2` to multiple external IPs on port 22.
- Activity aligned with timestamp and evidence in Microsoft's notice.

---

## Origin of Malicious Activity

**Ground Zero Identified:  `ff-vm-lx-224-base` (Azure Linux VM)**
On `sakel-lunix-2`, further activity was observed including `dash` execution, cron persistence, and SSH brute-force behavior that was ultimately flagged by Microsoft Azure Safeguards Team.

This investigation confirms `ff-vm-lx-224-base` as the earliest compromised host in the environment, acting as the attack origin from which lateral movement and outbound abuse campaigns were launched.

Just seconds before dash was executed on `ff-vm-lx-224-base`, it accepted an SSH connection from internal IP `10.0.0.8`, which was previously identified as an attacker pivot system.

This validates that:
- `ff-vm-lx-224-base` was compromised first
- The attacker pivoted internally to `10.0.0.8`
- From there, they reached `sakel-lunix-2` and other VMs

--- 

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Files/Processes:**
- `/usr/bin/dash` (abused for in-memory execution)
- PowerShell processes with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
- Scheduled task: AC Power Download
- Multiple sshd processes (on `ff-vm-lx-224-base`)

**IPs Contacted or Logged In to Compromised Hosts:**
- `168.63.129.16` (likely metadata)
- `31.128.3.244` - `31.128.3.247` (external SSH brute-force targets)
- `37.32.15.8`  (initial brute force attempts)
- `14.45.226.52` (external root login to sakel-lunix-2)
- `123.7.142.76` (root login to ff-vm-lx-224-base)

**Hash Values:**
- `dash` SHA1: `42e94914c7800c7063c51d7a17aec3a2069a3769`
- `grep` SHA1: `4364e3437c75199361968b77f556d29c097b93e5`
